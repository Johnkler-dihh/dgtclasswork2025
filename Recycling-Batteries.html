<h1>How To Recycle Batteries</h1>
<p class="pn" >Before we used to have only around 3 differnt battery chemistries, lead acid, nicad and alkaline, but nowdays there are so many its crazy. There are zinc-air batteries, alkaline, carbon zinc, nicad, lead acid, hydroxide batteries, hydrogen batteries and even nuclear batteries. There are so much more but for the sake of simplicity I will focus on showing you how to recycle carbon-zinc, alkaline, nicad and lead acid batteries.</p>
<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Lead acid battery</h1>
    <img class="imag2" src="pbh2so4batdia.png" alt="A lead Acid Battery diagram">
    <p class="shp">Out of any of the batteries listed today, lead acid batteries are the most dangerous. This is mainly becauselead is a very toxic heavy metal which once gets into your body stays there and also destroyed you from the inside out. Another reason is becuase it has sulpheric acid which if misused can melt any part of your body very quickly as this is the most concentrated form of sulpheric acid.</p>
    <p class="shp">Anyways, to get to the real dssassembly of the batery. Now ther is on thing i havent said that yo need, and that is a small hacksaw. The hacksaw is mportant as it will alow us to actuallcut through the thick plastic covering.Anyways, if we look at this pircue of this batery, we can see that instead of one big tack of free materials its actually indvual cells of bateries throughout the battery contaning h2so4 and lead. so wat we will need to do is sat into each cell from the bottom upside down and get 2 things. A plastic bucket and a bottle of bakind soda in solution (the baking soda is just incase if the acid spils on our body so that we can neutralise it immediatly). So, on the underside of each cell we want to cut a diamond on the edge, then once we have done this for all of the 6 cells we need to get our bucket and start pouring the acid into the bucket all at once. </p>
    <p class="shp">Now that the H2SO4 is fully drained out, transfer it into a conainer. Now al we have it a plastic box with lead and a bit of residual acid inside, so fo this we will just put the baking soda inside f those holes and give it a little swirl to rinse out each cell and make it neutral, do this as many times as you feel safe. So now all we need to do is use our hacksaw to fully cut though each cell vertically and just about 2 millimeters from each wall of the cell(An easy way to tell the wall of each cel is to look at the main battery and run your finder accros it horizontally, f we do this we will be able to feel certin valleys and hills, the hills are ethe walls and the alleys are the gaps ar the cells.) So once you cut into each cell you will find a mesh, metallic dense plate and a bronw place, the only thing we are interested in are the heavy shiny plates which is the lead.</p>

    <h2 class="shph1">Nickel Cadmium battery</h1>
    <img class="imag2" src="nicadbatdia.webp" alt="Nickel Cadmium Battery diagram">
    <p class="shp">Nickel Cadmium batteries or nicad for short were really popular and usefull batteries. This was becuase they were used in many applicatiosn that needed a safe yet good rechargeable battery.Only downside to this was that it used cadmium, which is way more toxic than lead as your body can litterally absorb this metal slowly through your skin. Other than the only other things we can get from this is nickel  oxide hydroxide which isnt toxic but for the average person has no use than just being a high energy dense catalyst. Although the last thing that is usefull is a steel shell/casing so you can make stuff like sinkers and whatnot.</p>
    <p class="shp">To start this, all you need to do is find the groove on the battery which is towards the negative terminal, then start using you hacksaw to carefully cut the steel shelling revealing the rolled up nicad conjustion. Then once you have that showing all you need to do is grap your Marksman noseplier tool and start pulling the main roll out. If that doesnt work just use your hacksaw and slowly saw above the area of the groove towards the positive terminal, as from there you should jus be able to pull out the guts and save it for later.</p>
    <p class="shp">Once you have these guts removed from the casing, go ahead and wear some chemical resistant gloves or latex gloves, then in a container start unraveling the roll, When you do so there should be 3 layers, a thick metal layer, a paper layer and right behind that paper ther should be this black pastey substance. All we want to do is get the metal layer and the shell, but with the other extracted chemicals/byproducts all we need to do it save it in a bag and give it to our local chemical reycling center. So now we have come unclean cadmium metal, all we need to do is get a containter of water and just give it a rinse, maybe 2 or 3 rinses but they would be able to get rid of these impurities. If you are mroe concered about thes eimpurites then go ahead and just grab a crucible and melt the metal in, then the impurities will just float to the top ready to be collected by a spoon(If you are doing this i wouldnt want to use the spoon ever again, even if it was cleaned with KOH).</p>

    <h2 class="shph1">Alkaline batteries</h1>
    <img width="300px" class="imag2" src="AlkBatDia.svg" alt="Alkaline battery diagram">
    <p class="shp">In our world by far these are the most common batteries used in the household enviroment, but by far the most usefull things we will get are a steel casing, manganese dioxide and a thin brass rod.</p>
    <p class="shp">And so to do this extraction, we basically repeat the same steps for the nicad battery, and so after we have taken out the negtive electrode along with its thin brass rod, all we need to do is pull out the middle silvery pastey substance that is seperated by paper.Once you pull this our all you now need to do is submerge the case with the black stuff into a glass of water for an hour, this allows it to start expand and allows water to push it out and make it soft to remove.Now that some time has passed, grab something slim but strong that will able to safely pry out the managnes dioxide.Now that you have pulled out all of the manganese dioxide you want to put this into a container of water and gently break it appart until it becomes a powder. Then shake this entire smoothie, and then after a while the MnO2 should settle out to the bottom and the carbon should float up or stay suspended in solution, all you want to do is carefully pour out the carbon leavin you with come clean MnO2, all you need to do now is let that dry off in the sun.  </p>

    <h2 class="shph1">Carbon Zinc Battery</h1>
    <img class="imag2" src="CarbZincBatDia.png" alt="Carbon Zinc battery">
    <p class="shp">By far this is one of the most usefull battery extractions.Im not only sayign this becuase its way way way less dangerous to do but also becuase you can use so much of these materials.</p>
    <p class="shp">Anyways to get started all you need to do is peel back the plastic wrapper showing the zinc shelling and plastic insulated positive electrode. Now all you want to do is carfully securely grab onto the tip of the positive electrode and pull it outin a screwing motion, this brings out the carbon rod and leaves it safe for us to extract the MnO2 and zinc. Now that we have the carbon rod free we can take a peep inside and see that the lip of the zinc casing is about 2 milimeters above the second plastic seperator, now all we need to do it use our nose pliers and grab the pulled in zinc shelling at the top and break it towards the back, this allows the rest of the zinc casing to come out safely and reveal the Mno2 thats securely tucked into the paper sperator.</p>
    <p class="shp">Now to seperate each of the impurites from the zinc and the mno2, all you wan to do is in a crucible melt the zinc, then after it has been melted put it into soe molds and let the impurites rise to the top ready for you to collect. Now for the MnO2 all you need to do is peel back the paper seperator and free the mno2 paste from the casing, then immediately dump this into a container of water and repeat the same steps for out MnO2 extraction on our alkaline battery.</p>
