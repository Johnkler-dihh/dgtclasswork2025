<p class="pn">In our modern world batteries power almost every handheld or wireless thing we have, which s what makes them hella usefull for us.But for almost all f use when these bateries die out we just chuck them away into our rubish bin not thinking twice that once these get punctured or even put into a place with a hot emperature, they begin to leach and give off toxic chemicals and elemns into the enviorment which damage our earth for years and years to come. This is where my site comes in, as unlike traditional methods of battery recycling which is to give your bateries to specific recycling centers i will teach you how you can safely, efficiently and effectively recycle batteries at your own house for valuable and usefull materials.</p>
