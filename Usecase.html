<h1>Usecases Of Recycled Materials</h1>

<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Carbon Rods</h1>
    <img class="imag" src="CR.jpg" alt="A picture of a graphite rod">
    <p class="shp">Carbon Rods have many industrial uses but less household applications which makes it ough to use for common people. But there are still some ideas to use this.</p>
    <p class="shp">The first usecase is as a less efficient pencil. This is because carbon rods use the same material that makes the pencil right which is graphite, Although in carbon rods it is way stronger and also has way bigger particle sizes compared to pencil lead which makes it rougher.</p>
    <p class="shp"> Another usecase for carbon rods is to grind it down to a powder(Do this outside and with a mask as this is the most purest form of carbon and breathin it wouldnt be prety good) and then with this grinded down powder you can put it into any mechanism like a drawer roller to make it more smoother and better. This works as graphite acts as a self lubricating susbstance which allows it to make mechanisms smoother and less harsh.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Zinc Shelling</h2>
    <img class="imag" src="Zinc.jpg" alt="A picture of zinc">
    <p class="shp">Zinc also like carbon rods have many industrial usecase but less of household uses. Although there is still stuff you can do with zinc.</p>
    <p class="shp">One thing you can do with zinc is remelt it into a bigger shape like a cube and then break it open to show its beautiful blue crystals inside. </p>
    <p class="shp">Other than that a more usefull usecase of zinc is in its antimicrobial property amon other things. And the way we use this is by makng something that may leverage that such as a spoon that is galvanised so that its easier to wash, or instead of using lead foil to help with cracks in your tiling, you can use zinc.This is usefull and healthy as zinc is a little less malleable than lead but instead of lead particles leachinbg into our water, its zinc whcih is a mineral that we need in our body.</p>

<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Steel Casing</h2>
    <img class="imag" src="sc.png" alt="Battery steel casing">
    <p class="shp">Out of all of the materials you can get from a battery, a steel casing has so many possibilities. And this is because the steel casing is made out fo stainless steel which stops it from rusting and negatively affecting whatever's inside.</p>
    <p class="shp">One of these useceses is as a storage system. This is nice as if you add a cap on it, it will allow it to be used for storage at basically every angle. In the casig you can put anything you want. From cash, pills, water, small bits of food, or anything else you want yu can put inside of it, and most importantly because its cylindrical you can layer it ontop of another. </p>
    <p class="shp">Another good use for this is in fishing. If you have some srap lead you can melt it into the casing and then drill a hole into it to pas a line through to make a damn cheap sinker, moreover you can get lead for basically free when you go into any scrapyard or abandonned lots as they're almost always there.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Manganese Dioxide</h2>
    <img class="imag" src="mno2.webp" alt="Manganese dioxdide(MnO2)">
    <p class="shp">Manganese dioxide is almot rarely used in the household enviroment which makes i hard to decide what you can do with it.</p>
    <p class="shp">But one thing i found out you can do at home is that once you dump the pastey powder into water, then mix it hard for a couple of seconds, the carbon becomes suspended into the water and the manganese dixide sits at the bottom which leaves us with clean magnanese dioxide.Once we dry it we can pour some oil into it and make some jet black oil paint.</p>
    <p class="shp">But one of the most fun way ive used manganese dioxide is using this in a 12 to 1 ratio wth fine aluminum powder to make sum Magnagnese thermite. This thermite reaction generates very very high temperatures, high enough to melt steel in a jiffy and more.Another thing is that after this reaction cools down you can salvage the manganese metal and sae it for medicinal use on wonds n stuff</p>

<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Sulpheric acid</h1>
    <img class="imag" src="h2so4.png" alt="Sulpheric Acid">
    <p class="shp">Sulpheric acid is one of the most corrosive acids that peopple can hget in nz. But still though it is so rare and hard to buy  in nz, not only that but every acid is.And so if we have sulferic acid we need to be extra precautious.</p>
    <p class="shp">one usecase of sulpheric acid is as a crain or an unclogger, this is because the acid litterally melts and dissolves everything in its way other than plastics and ceramics.</p>
    <p class="shp">One fun and good usecase of supheric acid is to store and deposit metals. This is basicaly a displacement reaction. We can do this by getting some copper from electrical wires then put them in a solution of sulpheric acid. What happens here is that the sulpheric acid takes the copper turning into a beautiful blue color. By itself you can use this as a pesticide, but if we put another metallic object into this colution, we can see some very fine copper molecules appear and the solution turns from a deep blue into the clear solution we had in the beginning.But its not truly clear as the copper has just switched out of the solution for whatever the metal was put in it.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="shph1">Lead</h1>
    <img class="imag" src="Lead.png" alt="Lead">
    <p class="shp">Lead is also a VERY VERY dangerous heavy metal. If ingested you get heavy metal poisoning, which basically means that theres lead in your blood and in your bones which instead of helping like minerals it destroyes it making you weaker and killing you.But there are some DAMN good usecases for it.</p>
    <p class="shp">One of these usecases is using it as a sinker when your fishing, this also works well as lead is one of the densest metal.</p>
    <p class="shp">Another usecase for lead is for radiation sheilding, which works as not only is lead actually reflective to photons, its also reflecive to beta and alpha particles which are the main radiactive decay particles. So to actually expreience radicativy and see this entire produce at play, you would want to take an xray machine and first use it to see if it works, if it does our in luck, but if it doesnt you need to get to fixng it. But now from the battery we just have raw lead plates-- which are just lead but somewhat unclean. And so what we need to do is just grab a hammer and start whacking the lead into a think foil. Now that we have the lead into a thick foil, we can start usign it as is. For this we just turn on our xray machne and then use the same subject, but instead of keeping the subject naked, we will cover a part of it with the lead sheel we have. Now if we look at the xray picture, we can see that the part covered by lead was completely blocked, whilst te other part without the covering was shown as is. </p>
